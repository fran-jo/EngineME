The project contains three scritps/interfaces: for OMC, Dy and JM
This interfaces require to install OpenModelica, Dymola and JModelica. (The script for JModelica needs to be updated)

To run any script you need to give three parameters, i.e.:
	[1] ./config/simResourcesOMC.properties
	[2] ./config/simConfigurationOMC.properties

[1] stores the resources a.k.a. model files and library files to work with
[2] stores the configuration of each modelica compilers

If simulations are successful, you will be prompted to a simple command line choice (multiple choices are allowed, 
separated by space)
[0] B4
[1] B5
[2] B6
[3] B7
[4] B1
[5] B2
[6] B3
[7] B8
[8] B9
Select which variable do you want to plot: 6 7 8
Results are stored into and .h5 file (hdfviewer is required to view the file with correct format) in the specified 
output path from simResourcesXXX.properties file)

The scripts have been tested within PyDev environment from Eclipse
